## Unsplash GraphQL

The unsplash API needs a sign in. https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-authentication.

    query UnsplashQueries(
      $unsplash_clientId: Secret!
    ) {
      unsplash_Stats_Month(
        unsplash_clientId: $unsplash_clientId
      ) {
        new_developers
        new_requests
      }
      unsplash_Collections(
        unsplash_clientId: $unsplash_clientId
      ) {
        curated
        featured
        id
        private
      }
      unsplash_Stats(
        unsplash_clientId: $unsplash_clientId
      ) {
        applications
        downloads
        developers
      }
      unsplash_Search(
        query: "red"
        unsplash_clientId: $unsplash_clientId
      ) {
        results
      }
    }

## RunQuery.py

My take on `runquery.py` started with several challenges, first you need a special version to include aiohttp. Second the published GraphQL API still needs some additional parameters...

Lets see where this leads us.
